            <p>Studii gives compensation to the contributors (the teachers) everytime their contributions (exercise questions) are attempted.</p>
            <p>In the endgame, Studii is built to help everybody, the students and the teachers.</p>
            <p>However, it is important for us to make clear a few things. Those are:</p>
            <br>
            <ol style="font-size:1.3em">
                <li>The price per attempt (meaning : how much contributors get for every attempt) are fully decided by Studii.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Studii has the right to put a limit on compensation for contributors.</li>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>This may happen if there is any financial constraint that will put Studii at difficulty.</li>
                    <li>If so, we will contact the contributors personally. The contributors may decide if they want to stop serving the questions, or allow it
                    to be served without compensation.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
