            <p><b>Disclaimer</b></p>
            <p>Studii gives compensation to the contributors (the teachers) everytime their contributions (exercise questions) are attempted.</p>
            <p>However, it is important for us to make clear a few things. Those are:</p>
            <br>
            <ol style="font-size:1.3em">
                <li>The price per attempt (meaning : how much contributors get for every attempt) are fully decided by Studii.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Studii has the right to stop serving questions from any contributors. This may happen depending on Studii's financial constraint. This is because
                    Studii operates on ads, and ads are not consistent.</li>
            </ol>
